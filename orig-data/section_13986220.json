Since then, many exciting games have been contested, including the 1973 All-Star Game, three no-hitters, playoff games in 1976, '77, '78, '80, '81, '84 and '85 and seven World Series tilts in 1980 and 1985. The facility was officially renamed in honor of Ewing M. Kauffman in a ceremony at the stadium on July 2, 1993. </p>\n<p>Before the 2004 season, the outfield fences in the gaps and in straight-away center field were moved back 10 feet to their original dimensions of 387 and 410, respectively, making Kauffman Stadium one of the most spacious parks in Major League Baseball. In addition, the warning track was changed to a natural surface, and the height of the fence is now at 8 feet. The fences were moved in 10 feet from bullpen to bullpen prior to the 1995 season and lowered from 12 feet to 9 feet. Also at that time, a grass playing field replaced the artificial surface at Kauffman Stadium. </p>\n<p>Kauffman Stadium's unique features include a a 322-foot wide water spectacular. The water spectacular is the largest privately funded fountain in the world.</p>\n<p>In keeping with the architecture of the stadium, the existing water spectacular featuring cascading water now extends near the left field corner.</p>\n<p>Prior to the 1999 campaign, additional field level seating, known as \"Crown Seats\" and four dugout suites were added. </p>\n<p>The renaming of the stadium was appropriate in that it was the strength and integrity of Ewing M. Kauffman's ownership that provided the cornerstone for the Royals success. Kauffman purchased the club as an expansion franchise in 1968 with the primary and continuous motivation of providing winning Major League Baseball for Kansas Citians. Kauffman, who founded Marion Laboratories in his mother's basement and built it into a diversified health care company with sales reaching nearly one billion dollars, possessed a sense of daring and an innate ability to motivate those around him. \"Mr. K\" also gave much personal attention to the Kansas City community, an important philosophy that was inbred into the Royals organization and still remains today.</p>\n<p>Among the awards Mr. Kauffman won for his leadership include the Kansas City Press Club's 1973 Man of the Year, an induction into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame and was one of 20 finalists for enshrinement in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. Mr. K passed away on Aug. 1, 1993.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  <span class=\"hlXs\">Kauffman Stadium Milestones</span> <br />\n  <br />\n <ul class=\"bullet_round_black\">\n \t<li><b>July 11, 1968</b> - Ground is broken for Kansas City's Harry S.

The Royals designed this system in order to provide a safer, more efficient experience for our fans.\n<br><br>The plan will safely accommodate more fans by using all points-of-entry and reducing pedestrian-vehicle congestion points. These updates are consistent with the parking and access plans utilized at most major sports and entertainment venues, including Arrowhead Stadium.</dd>\n \n\n  <dt><strong>What, specifically, is the number one thing fans can do to ensure a smooth experience when parking at Kauffman Stadium?</strong></dt>\n  <dd>The overall message is simple: please take a couple of minutes before your trip to Kauffman Stadium and plan your route by consulting royals.com/parking. By doing so, you'll ensure a pleasant experience when arriving at the Stadium.</dd>\n  \n  <dt><strong>Who should I contact if I have questions about parking?</strong></dt>\n  <dd><strong>For additional information, please e-mail <a href=\"mailto:ticketservices@royals.com\">ticketservices@royals.com</a> or call 816-504-4040 option 3.</strong> Fans may also visit royals.com/parking for more information and detailed maps.</dd>\n \n  <dt><strong> Will it take longer to enter the Stadium now that the parking plan has changed?</strong></dt>\n  <dd>No. In fact, the redesigned plan was created to streamline traffic flow throughout the complex, especially for games that will draw large crowds, by utilizing all points-of-entry and eliminating pedestrian-vehicle congestion.\n\t<br><br>\nOf course, the key to make parking at Kauffman Stadium quick and easy is to take a few minutes to plan your route prior to departing for the ballpark.\n</dd>\n\t\n\t<dt><strong>How much does it cost to park at Kauffman Stadium?</strong></dt>\n\t<dd>Parking is $10 for cars and motorcycles, $11 for oversized vehicles and $15 for buses and empty tractor-trailers. An oversized vehicle is any vehicle that takes up more than one parking space. </dd>\n\t<dd>*Day of parking is cash only.</dd>\n\n  <dt><strong> What time do the tollgates open on gamedays?</strong></dt>\n  <dd>The tollgates are staffed with parking personnel beginning several hours prior to the scheduled first pitch. The specific time depends on the anticipated attendance. Please note that the Royals Box Office opens at 9:00 a.m. on gamedays and is accessible through Gates 2, 5 and 6 for fans purchasing tickets and then exiting the Truman Sports Complex. You can also <strong>buy your tickets on royals.com</strong> up to game time, and <strong>print your tickets at home</strong>, get them <strong>delivered to your mobile phone</strong>, or have them waiting for you at Will Call. <br />\n <ul class=\"related_content\"><li> <a href=\"/ticketing/index.jsp?c_id=kc\"><img src=\"/mlb/images/buttons/green/bu_buytixnow_154x17.gif\" width=\"154\" height=\"17\" alt=\"Buy Tickets Now\" border=\"0\"/></a></li></dd>\n\n  <dt><strong>How will you determine in which specific lot I park?</strong></dt>\n  <dd>Upon entering, parking personnel will direct you to the appropriate lot (Gold Reserved, Blue Reserved or general) closest to the Stadium with available spaces.</dd>\n\n  <dt><strong>I noticed Gate 1 is now closed to the general public. Why the change and what is the best gate for entering from Blue Ridge Cutoff?</strong></dt>\n  <dd>Gate 1 posed multiple access issues: 1) With only one toll-gate, this entrance regularly became backed-logged with guests trying to access the Stadium parking lot. 2) Gate 1 required cars to travel on Red Coat Drive, which is a main pedestrian walk-way.\n\t<br><BR>For fans accessing the Stadium from Blue Ridge Cutoff, simply travel a short distance past Gate 1 and enter at Gate 2, Gate 3 or Gate 4.</dd>\n\t\n\n  <dt><strong> I usually sit on the third-base side but prefer to enter the Stadium from Blue Ridge Cutoff. Can I still do this?</strong></dt>\n  <dd>Absolutely. While the new plan is designed to eliminate cross-traffic between the east and west parking lots, we understand that fans may choose to park on the side of the Stadium that is most convenient for them to access. In this example, fans may enter the parking lot from Blue Ridge Cutoff, park on the east side of the Stadium, and make their way to the third-base (west) side of the seating bowl.</dd>\n\n  <dt><strong>Will I be parking farther from the Stadium than I have in the past?</strong></dt>\n   <dd>No. The new parking plan will utilize the same lots as in past years, but the lots will now be categorized differently - Gold Reserved for officials and VIP guests, Blue Reserved for season ticket holders and general parking for guests who purchase parking on a game-by-game basis. All lot types will be available on each side of the stadium.</dD>\n   \n \t  <dt><strong> How does this new parking plan affect how I'll exit the Stadium?</strong></dt>\n   <dd>All tollgates and roads used to access Kauffman Stadium will also be open to accommodate traffic exiting the Truman Sports Complex, and guests will be directed out of the complex via access roads that are nearest to their parking lot. Simply put, you will be asked to exit the same way that you entered.</dd>\n\n  <dt><strong>I would like to purchase tickets at Kauffman Stadium early in the day before the crowd arrives for the game. What procedures do I need to follow?</strong></dt>\n  <dd>The Royals will have advance ticket booths located at the main box office at Gate C that are open Mon-Fri 9am-6pm and Sat & Sun 9a.m.-4p.m. As in parking for the game, please refer to royals.com/parking for the best route to access the stadium from your point-of-origin.</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul class=\"related_content\"><li>\n<p><a class=\"primaryVlink\" href=\"/kc/ballpark/parking.jsp\"><strong> Return to the Kauffman Stadium Parking page</strong></a></p>\n</li>"
