Cleaning immediately after games also ensures the facility is ready for events other than baseball that occur in the building on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>Housekeeping lights will remain on for a minimum of 8 hours after the conclusion of a game and likely longer. Nearly 150 people work to clean the facility inside and out and it takes that long to work through the 1 million square feet of space that makes up Target Field.</p>\n\n<p>About two hours after the debris clean up begins, pressure washing is scheduled to start as an eight-hour shift. For example with a typical Sunday first pitch at 1:10 PM game, the Arena Team start at 5:00 pm and the Pressure Wash Team started at 7:00 pm and works until 3:00-3:30 a.m. Because the cleaning service supervisors continue to inspect the work and clean-up puddles after the pressure washing crews finish, there are several crew leaders here until about 4:00 a.m. When all work is completed, crews advise the operations center and the lights are turned off.\n</p>\n\n<p>Target Field stadium and/or housekeeping lights will also be illuminated on occasion and as necessary for testing and maintenance, but the majority of those occurrences will be during the day.</p>\n"
