Steps to setup and run queries:
------------------------------
1) Ensure ES is running at localhost:9200
2) run ./load.sh es-test
   This will create an es-test index and load the sample data.
3) run ./working.sh to run the queries that are returning results.
4) run ./not_working.sh to run the queries that are returning results.

Note: The difference between the working and not working version, is the absence of "minimum_number_should_match" : 1
