Scenario:
--------
Re-Indexing issues resulting in invalid search results, when mappings are changed in a live system and re-applied after all the documents and the respective mappings were deleted.
 
Steps to setup and reproduce:
------------------------------
1) Ensure ES is running at localhost:9200 (look at configuration below)
2) run ./automate.sh.
   a) This will create an es-test index with the seed mappings and load the sample data.
   b) Then it fires a query which returns results correctly ie 2 audio and 1 video
3) Now run ./reconfigure.sh 
   a) This first deletes all the audio documents and the corresponding audio mapping.
   b) Then its refreshes the indices and does an expunge of the deleted audio documents.
   c) Then it puts the new mapping for audio and does a load of the sample data.
   d) Then it fires a query, same as step 2b above, which returns results incorrectly now i.e 1 video is only returned.
