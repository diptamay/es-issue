Steps to setup and run queries:
------------------------------
1) Ensure ES is running at localhost:9200
2) run ./automate.sh
   a) This will create an es-test index and load the sample data.
   b) Then it fire ./not_working.sh to run the query which is not working always.
   c) It will then delete the documents.

Note: The difference between the working and not working version, is the absence of "minimum_number_should_match" : 1
