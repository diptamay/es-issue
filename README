Scenario:
--------
When dynamic templates are defined in seed mappings, they get correctly applied ONLY when ONE template is define and not when multiple templates are present.
 
Steps to setup and reproduce:
------------------------------
1) Ensure ES is running at localhost:9200 (look at configuration below)
2) run ./automate.sh.
   a) This will create an es-test index with the seed mappings and load the sample data.
   b) Then it fires a query which returns results correctly.
3) Now look at the metadata generated by ES. 
   a) You will see that the dynamic templates got applied for the "video" type.
   b) You will see the templates did not kick in for the "lineup" type. Note: multiple templates have been provided for lineup in the seed.
